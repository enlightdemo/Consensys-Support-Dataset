#### Looking for information on NFTs in MetaMask?


This article is specifically about displaying NFTs in MetaMask Portfolio at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/). For information about NFTs in MetaMask Extension or Mobile, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058238591).



Let's break this down depending on which of these two issues you're experiencing:


An NFT is missing
-----------------


MetaMask Portfolio works by leveraging data indexing services that compile (index) on-chain activity so that we can display it in the application. Sometimes, **NFTs may not display on your dashboard because these services have not yet indexed them**.


In these cases, please wait a short while. If you've already been waiting a significant time, and you can [verify on a block explorer](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611) that the NFT is in your account, please contact us via the 'Support' button in the bottom-left corner of MetaMask Portfolio.


An NFT is not displaying correctly
----------------------------------


Just like major NFT platforms such as OpenSea, we need to be able to access NFT metadata for the dapp to display the NFT image, GIF, or video. Metadata refers to the various characteristics of the token that define it: aspects such as quantity, rarity, name, description, etc. 


The metadata itself should ideally be in a standardized format which our dapp is built to interpret. **If the image metadata (or visual metadata more generally) is not in a supported format, it won't be displayed in the dapp**. We're working on adding support for more formats and ensuring as many NFTs display correctly as possible. 


However, if you don't see your NFT image and just a placeholder instead, rest assured nothing has happened to it; it is still safely in your account on-chain.
