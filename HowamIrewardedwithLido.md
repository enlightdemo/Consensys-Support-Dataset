With Lido the number of stETH tokens in your wallet increases or decreases based on the performance of the protocol to reflect any rewards you may receive. Lido typically updates token balances on a daily basis. stETH is withdrawable on a 1:1 basis for ETH. 


For example, if you initially hold 1 stETH and your share of stETH on Lido gets you 0.1 ETH in rewards over time, your balance would be expected to update to show that you hold 1.1 stETH.


If you want to skip the manual calculations, you can easily check the amount of your rewards in the Stake section of MetaMask Portfolio, under the ‘Lifetime Rewards’ column.


You can exit your staking position by withdrawing or swapping your stETH. See our [article](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/11834605248923) for more information.
