**Finding transactions on the block explorer**
----------------------------------------------


### Firstly: what is a block explorer?


Essentially, block explorers are independent sites which retrieve information about activity on the blockchain, organise it, and make it freely available online. With the help of block explorers, all network (blockchain) activity can be quickly queried, helping ensure total transparency. 


Although their barrage of [long, hexadecimal numbers](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4702972178459) and highly specific terminology can be intimidating at first, block explorers are very easy to use. These skills will form a vital element in your toolkit for using Web3. 


Block explorers are specific to each blockchain: Ethereum has its own ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)), BSC has its own ([BscScan](https://bscscan.com/)), etc. 


Make sure you're using the right site by heading to the relevant network profile from our [hub](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415750833691), which covers many of the most popular EVM-compatible blockchains. 


### Finding transactions


Although there are distinctions between each block explorer, they broadly look the same. The steps below will apply regardless of the network you're using:


1. Open up the appropriate block explorer. [Network profiles accessible from our hub](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415750833691) can help you find it.
2. [Copy your wallet address.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289512-How-to-copy-your-MetaMask-account-public-address-)
3. Paste your address into the search bar to open up your wallet's page.
4. Locate the transaction in the list provided.
