**Network control** is the estimated percentage of staking validators associated with each provider, as calculated by the [rated.network](https://www.rated.network/) API.


**Popularity** is an estimate of the fiat value of ETH staked with each provider. This is calculated by multiplying the estimated number of staking validators associated with the provider—obtained via the [rated.network](https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=pool) API—by an estimate of 32 ETH staked per validator.
