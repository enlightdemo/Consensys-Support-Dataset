When viewing your holdings, you'll see two variants of estimated rewards which are calculated slightly differently: 


* **Estimated lifetime rewards**: Lifetime rewards are an estimate of how many rewards you’ve received from the staking provider, calculated using a mix of on-chain data, data via API from the [Lido subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/HXfMc1jPHfFQoccWd7VMv66km75FoxVHDMvsJj5vG5vf?view=Overview) and [Rocket Pool subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/S9ihna8D733WTEShJ1KctSTCvY1VJ7gdVwhUujq4Ejo?view=Overview) from The Graph, and data via API from CoinGecko. It may include rewards you may have received from holdings acquired outside of MetaMask Staking.
* **Estimated current rewards**: Current rewards is the percentage of annual rewards you are predicted to receive, subject to change, based on a provider’s performance over the last week, as calculated by each provider's API.
