MetaMask can access many more networks than just Ethereum mainnet: you can add any EVM-compatible network. 


The initialism RPC stands for remote procedure call, a set of protocols that allow a client (such as MetaMask) to interact with a blockchain. 



#### Adding via Chainlist


For an easy way of adding networks to MetaMask, go to [chainlist.wtf](https://chainlist.wtf/), where you can connect MetaMask and add networks with only a few clicks. See our [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058992772) for more information. 



Also, please note that **adding a network on one device does not mean it will appear on another device** when accessing the same account. If you add it on Extension, it will not automatically be added to your MetaMask Mobile app, and vice versa.


Custom networks will also need to re-added if you uninstall the browser extension or mobile app (after which you'd need to [restore your wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612) using your Secret Recovery Phrase).



#### Why am I seeing a question mark icon next to the network name after I add it?


When you add a custom network to MetaMask — i.e. any network other than Ethereum mainnet — you'll see a question mark icon next to it in the network selector. It looks like this:


![MetaMask_network_question_mark.png](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16214959337755)


Don't be concerned! This doesn't mean it's not legitimate or not safe to use. It is intended behaviour and is how any network you add will appear in MetaMask.



 


Adding popular networks
-----------------------


On both Mobile and Extension, you can easily add several prominent networks with just a tap. These include:


* [BNB Chain/BSC](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415758120219)
* [Polygon](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415758346267)
* [Avalanche](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415758179355)
* [Arbitrum](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415758358299)
* [Optimism](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415758352667)

Adding a network manually
-------------------------


The following are instructions for establishing these connections manually:




Extension Mobile


1. Click on the **network selector button**. This will display a list of networks to which you're already connected.
2. Click 'Add network':


![MetaMask Extension add network](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16214915300123)


3. A new browser tab will open, displaying various fields to fill out**:**


![MetaMask Extension add custom network](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16214959342107)


Complete the fields and click save to add the network. 


The details for the above fields can be found in our [network profiles](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415750833691) or, alternatively, docs (i.e. developer documentation) or how-to guides for each network. For example:


	* [Binance Smart Chain (BSC)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain#:~:text=Mainnet%20(This%20is,https%3A//bscscan.com)
	* [Polygon](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/)
	* [Avalanche](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche).After performing the above steps, you will be able to see the custom network the next time you access the network selector.
