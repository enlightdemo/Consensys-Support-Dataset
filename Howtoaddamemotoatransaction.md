When you make a transaction to certain exchanges, the exchange sometimes requires you to add a memo to the transaction.  
  
To add a **memo or a note** during the transaction please enable Hex data on the extension in **Settings > Advanced > Show Hex Data:**

After you enable it, an extra optional field will appear during the transaction where you can fill in your memo:
