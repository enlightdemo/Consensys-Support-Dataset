[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) allows you to search and track the Ethereum blockchain for **transactions, addresses, tokens, prices,** and other activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. For links to the block explorers **for other networks, scroll to the bottom**. However, they all function very similarly, so the guidance below will probably also apply to whichever site you access.


To check your account details on **Ethereum Mainnet**, please enter your [public address](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488791) into the search bar on etherscan.io, and you will see all of your account activity and transaction details.

After you enter your MetaMask public address, which is on **Ethereum mainnet,** you will see the ETH balance in native value, today's fiat value and a separate total balance of all your custom ERC-20 tokens. You will also see all the up-to-date transactions in your wallet.Â

This balance should reflect in your MetaMask wallet. If you don't see your custom token, you need to add it manually following [this article.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-and-Custom-Tokens-in-Metamask) If you're still having issues finding the tokens or your Ether balance isn't the same in your MetaMask wallet, see [this article](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360028059272-What-to-do-when-your-balance-of-ETH-and-or-ERC20-tokens-is-incorrect-inaccurate).


**Note**: if you deposit/send your token on a non-Ethereum Mainnet network you can check your balance and transactions on a different explorer:
