When you create your MetaMask wallet, you will be given a Secret Recovery Phrase, and an account is automatically generated. Youâ€™ll see that as your *Account 1* (default account).


If you'd like to create and manage multiple MetaMask accounts, you could do so simply by creating more accounts. Each of these is then associated with the same Secret Recovery Phrase: think of your wallet (your Secret Recovery Phrase) as a container of one or more accounts.


If you want to re-add accounts after restoring your wallet using your Secret Recovery Phrase, take a look at [this article](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489271).
