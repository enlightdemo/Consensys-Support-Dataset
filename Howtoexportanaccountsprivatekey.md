#### Warning!


Exporting your account could be risky as it displays your private key in clear text. To avoid possible loss of funds, **make sure no one else sees or is able to capture a screenshot while you retrieve your private key**. Many phishing campaigns ask for your private key to gain access to your account. You should **never share your private key with anyone**, including the MetaMask team. No MetaMask representative, including our Support team, will ever ask for your private key, regardless of the context. If someone does ask for your private key, assume they are trying to scam you, and **do not** hand it over.

An Ethereum account's private key can be used to import it into any compatible wallet. Naturally, to import your account elsewhere via private key, you'll need to locate it in MetaMask first. Here's how:




Extension Mobile


1. Click on the identicon in the top right.
2. Select the account you'd like to export.
3. On the account page, click on the menu (three dots) in the upper right corner, and then on the "Account Details" button.
4. Click “Export Private Key”.
5. To access your private key, you'll now need to enter your wallet password. Once you've done so, click “Confirm” to proceed.
6. Your private key will now be revealed. Click to copy it, and save it somewhere safe. (Note: we aren't showing it in the below screenshot for obvious reasons -- but yours will be there.)
7. Click “Done” to close the screen.
