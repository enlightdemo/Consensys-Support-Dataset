#### Looking for how to remove tokens in MetaMask?


This article is specifically about managing displayed assets in the MetaMask Portfolio dashboard, available at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/). For information on displaying tokens in MetaMask, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031). For specific details on removing tokens from MetaMask, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058451852).Â 



The MetaMask Portfolio dashboard automatically identifies the assets in your account(s) and displays them in your assets list. You can remove a token or NFT from your assets list if you no longer want it included.



#### Note


**Hiding tokens or NFTs does not affect ownership**; the actual balance in your account, as recorded on the blockchain, remains unchanged. Following these instructions hides them in your dashboard.





Tokens NFTs


1. On your assets list, find the token you want to hide.
2. When you mouseover the token, three vertical dots appear on the far right. This is the **Token actions** menu; click it to continue.
3. Select the option to **Hide**.
4. Confirm your choice in the menu that appears, and the token will no longer be visible amongst your assets.

Now you'll be able to select additional NFTs to hide simply by clicking on them, or, if it's just the one you want rid of, click 'Hide 1' in the bar at the bottom of the screen.



Unhiding tokens and NFTs
------------------------


Hiding assets of both kinds is completely reversible.


To unhide tokens, go to Settings > Hidden tokens and click the plus button next to the asset.


To unhide NFTs, go to the NFTs page of your portfolio by flicking the toggle on the right-hand side of the dashboard. Your NFTs will be categorized into two tabs: 'Owned' and 'Hidden'. Head to 'Hidden' and click the ellipsis on any NFT to call up the option to unhide it.
