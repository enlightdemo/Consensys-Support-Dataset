We are always interested in hearing how our users would like to use and improve MetaMask.


Please post your request to our [Community forum](http://community.metamask.io/). You can also access this in-app if you're using MetaMask Mobile. Simply tap the hamburger icon in the top left to bring up the menu, and then select 'Request a Feature' at the bottom.

Before you submit a new request, have a look to see if someone else hasn't already suggested it — in this case, it's better to upvote theirs rather than add another.


Rest assured there's a lot of behind-the-scenes development that goes on at MetaMask, but we're keen to hear and integrate user requests wherever feasible. Posts on the Community requests page are regularly considered by our developers.
