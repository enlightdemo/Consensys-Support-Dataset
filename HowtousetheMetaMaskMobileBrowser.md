One of the most useful features of MetaMask Mobile is its built-in browser.


This enables you to use your MetaMask wallet to interact with dapps directly on your smartphone, without having to access a desktop browser. Note that you **have to access dapps using the in-app browser in MetaMask**, rather than any other browser available on your device. On other browsers, you won't be able to connect to dapps using MetaMask. 


In this guide, we'll use the classic blockchain video game Cryptokitties as an example, but the steps are essentially the same for any web3-enabled website:


1. Make sure you've selected the account you want to use for accessing dapps. To do this, tap on the hamburger icon in the top left and tap your account name to select from the list.

2. Open the browser by tapping on the browser tab at the bottom of the screen:

3. Open a new tab using search bar, or my clicking the magnifying glass icon, and navigate to the website or app you are interested in:

As with most web3 applications, Cryptokitties asks to connect to your wallet. Here's the real convenience of the MetaMask Mobile browser: **you've already selected your account**, so it's all queued up and ready. With a tap, you can sign in with that account and start playing:

Keep in mind that the browser is not as fully-featured as a standalone mobile browser application such as Chrome or Firefox. There may be things that don't work. But if you're trying to mint an NFT on the go, or check out a new web3 project that you might want to spend some time on later, it's just the right solution.


Also, **keep track of what applications you give permissions to**, and **be careful which permissions you give** them. (Though dapp connections are much more innocuous than their potentially dangerous relative, [token approvals](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683).)
