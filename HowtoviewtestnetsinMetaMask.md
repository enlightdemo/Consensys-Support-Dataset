If you want to use the Ethereum testnets Goerli and Sepolia, head to Settings > Advanced, and make sure 'Show test networks' is turned on: 


![MetaMask show test networks](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/13957074039323)


Once this setting is turned on, switch to a testnet by heading to the network selector at the top of the homepage and scrolling until you find the one you need:

If you're using MetaMask Mobile, testnets are listed in the network selector by default.
