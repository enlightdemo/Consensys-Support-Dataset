Some staking protocols provide individuals who stake with them with *liquid staking tokens* that represent their proportional claim to ETH in the protocol. Lido’s liquid staking token is stETH and Rocket Pool’s is rETH.


You can exit your staking position by swapping or withdrawing your staked ETH. For more information on this process, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/11834605248923).
