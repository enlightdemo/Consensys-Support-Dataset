When you stake through MetaMask, we route your transaction and ETH (minus any fees) to your selected staking provider. Your ETH is deposited into their protocol, and you receive liquid staking tokens directly from them in return. These tokens, such as Lido’s stETH or Rocket Pool’s rETH, represent your proportional claim to ETH in their protocol.
