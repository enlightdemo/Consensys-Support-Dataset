Lido is a liquid staking protocol for Ethereum that allows users with less than 32 ETH to collectively fund new validators and receive rewards. Lido outsources the technical and operational complexity of operating an Ethereum validator to a permissioned group of validator operators.


When you deposit ETH into Lido, you receive Lidoâ€™s liquid staking token, stETH, which represents your proportional claim to ETH in Lido. As validators operating on Lido receive rewards, you are eligible to receive rewards proportional to your stake, which is typically expected to occur daily.


When you stake ETH with Lido, Lido sends you stETH on a 1:1 basis equivalent to the amount of ETH staked, so that if you were to stake 1 ETH you would be issued 1 stETH in return.
