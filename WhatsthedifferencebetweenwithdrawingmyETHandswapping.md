Withdrawing staked ETH and rewards involves exchanging your stETH or rETH for ETH directly with the Lido or Rocket Pool protocols. For more information on withdrawals, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/11834605248923).


A swap involves trading your stETH or rETH back for ETH, often via a third-party exchange, and does not typically involve shutting down a validator. Swaps are subject to fluctuating market prices, so you may want to consider waiting for withdrawals. To easily swap your liquid staking tokens through the MetaMask Staking interface, find the position you’d like to exit from, click the three dots on the right next to your position, and click “Swap”.
