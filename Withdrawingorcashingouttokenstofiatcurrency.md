If you have ETH or other tokens that you want to exchange for fiat currency, you will have to do so on an exchange, as **MetaMask does not provide this service**. This means sending the tokens manually to the exchange platform of your choice.Â 


When you do so, please bear in mind:


* **You will need some of network's native tokens in order to pay gas fees for the transaction of sending the tokens**. This could be ETH for Ethereum mainnet, for example, or BNB or MATIC for BNB Smart Chain or Polygon respectively.
* **You need to ensure the exchange supports the network and tokens you're using**. For example, if you're sending MATIC, make sure the exchange supports the type of MATIC you're using (ERC-20 or native). You should not send native MATIC (on Polygon itself) to an exchange that only supports the ERC-20 MATIC, as you'll most likely lose the tokens forever. Be sure to check the exchange's support documentation to verify which network you should send on.
